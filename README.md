- Components : They are the main building blocks for our applications. Each component consists of:
An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
A TypeScript class that defines behavior
A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template.

- Model classes : Here we have the classes we need in order to identify several values. 

### Extra structure :
- Test class : there is one test class for the Admin as an example.
